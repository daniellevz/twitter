1.when using utils, have context issues (need a lot of things from server)
possible solution-> context with all the global things. anything nicer?

2. when have configuration that belong to subclass (mq confs) what is best practice? put them in class or in gloaval config?

3. how to move logs to model (forexample exchange- config, param in __init__ orjustprint instead of logs?)
